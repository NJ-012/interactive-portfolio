# ⚛️ 3D Knowledge Graph Portfolio | Niyati Joshi

An "Experience Engineering" showcase that transforms a traditional professional profile into a dynamic, interactive 3D environment. This project visualizes my technical expertise and academic achievements as a navigable network of interconnected nodes.

## 🛠️ The Tech Stack

This website is a specialized frontend project designed to demonstrate high-performance 3D rendering in the browser.

### **Core Frameworks**
* **React.js & Vite:** For a fast, component-based UI architecture.
* **Tailwind CSS:** Used for the responsive glassmorphism overlays and UI typography.

### **3D Engine & Graphics**
* **Three.js:** The primary WebGL engine for 3D rendering.
* **React Three Fiber (R3F):** A React reconciler for Three.js that bridges declarative UI with 3D objects.
* **React Three Drei:** For advanced 3D abstractions and smooth camera controls.
* **Postprocessing:** Implementation of cinematic Bloom and Glow effects to highlight technical nodes.

## 💡 Key Interactive Features

* **Programmatic Camera Flight:** The camera intelligently "flies" to specific coordinates as users interact with the knowledge tracker, providing a cinematic narrative flow.
* **Interactive Node System:** Custom-built orbital system where each node represents a verified skill or project (e.g., **Swift-Init-Wizard**, **NPTEL Elite DSA status**).
* **Experience Engineering Philosophy:** Designed to bridge the gap between complex technical data and intuitive visual storytelling.
* **Responsive 3D Canvas:** Adaptive field-of-view (FOV) logic that ensures the 3D scene remains immersive across mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
